## Printf

# Synopsis
In this project we attempt to create our own printf, also known as the print function. We will implement a simple function that outputs data in a given format, just like the standard input/output printf() function found in the standard library.

#Project Requirements
* All files must be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.
* No use of any global variables.
* Code must conform to the Betty riting and documentation style.
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
