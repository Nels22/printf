## Printf

# Synopsis
In this project we attempt to create our own printf, also known as the print function. We will implement a simple function that outputs data in a given format, just like the standard input/output printf() function found in the standard library.

# Project Requirements
* All files must be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.
* No use of any global variables.
* Code must conform to the Betty riting and documentation style.
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.

# Authorized functions and Macros
* malloc (man 3 malloc)
* free (man 3 free)
* va_start (man 3 va_start)
* va_end (man 3 va_end)
* va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
* write (man 2 write)
* va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

# File Descriptions
*  _printf.c: a function that produces output according to a specified format.
* _putchar.c: a function that writes a character to stdout.
* main.h: header file that contains all the function prototypes and macros.
* man_3_printf: - manual page for the custom _printf function.
